### 🎨 **PROJECT PROMPT: P5 – Branded Social Digest (Fun, Animated Version)**

---

### 🧭 **Objective:**

Design a **playful, highly personalized, and colorful digest web experience** that delivers curated social media insights (from YouTube and X) for brands. It should feel like an animated editorial, **tailored to each brand’s niche and tone** — not a dashboard, but a living, breathing brand report.

All digests are formatted as a **single scrollable page** with delightful microinteractions, creative transitions, and embedded content blocks (tweets/videos).

---

### 🌈 **Visual & UX Design Style:**

* **Colorful & Dynamic**, not sterile or overly minimal
* Personalize **theme colors** based on brand **niche** (e.g., pastel peach for beauty, vibrant purples for tech, greens for sustainability)
* Light mode only (for now), but well-contrasted and soft on the eyes
* Fluid, animated UI — scrolling should feel like flipping through a designer magazine
* Drop shadows, soft gradients, interactive cards
* Responsive for mobile/tablet/desktop

---

### 🧩 **Core Components to Include:**

#### ✅ **1. Newsletter Digest Layout (1 page, fully scrollable)**

This is the main page where the digest appears. Break it into creative, animated blocks:

---

**🎬 Header / Intro Block:**

* Brand logo + name
* “Digest for: \[Niche]” subline
* Timeframe: “Last 48 Hours”
* Soft animated background (e.g., color blobs, floating icons related to niche)
* CTA buttons: Send to Slack | Copy to Notion | Save Digest

---

  * Real-time metric ticker: likes, views, shares
  * 🖼️ Thumbnail or preview image
  * **Embedded tweet or YouTube video** (auto expands on hover or tap)
  * "Why it worked" blurb — AI-generated insight

✨ **Animation Ideas:**

* Cards lift on hover
* Smooth slide-in of text on scroll

🎨 Use speech-bubble or quote-block styles, color-coded by sentiment

* Creator cards:

  * Avatar
  * Handle + mini-bio

### 🎨 **Dynamic Color Theming (Based on Brand Niche)**

Build a color theme engine that maps each **niche** to a tailored **light color palette**:

| Niche          | Primary Color | Accent  | Font Color |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Skincare       | #FDE6E6       | #FFB6B6 | #333333    |
| Fintech        | #F0F9FF       | #00A6FB | #1A1A1A    |
| Sustainability | #E8F5E9       | #4CAF50 | #2F2F2F    |
| Gaming         | #F3E5F5       | #AB47BC | #212121    |
| Tech/Dev       | #E3F2FD       | #2979FF | #2A2A2A    |

Each theme changes:

* Background gradients
* Card colors
* Buttons
* Fonts & accents

### 🖼️ **Embedded Post Components**

Build reusable components for **YouTube & Twitter post embeds**:

#### 1. `YouTubePostEmbed`:

```ts
props: {
  videoId: string,
  title: string,
  thumbnail: string,
  summary: string,
  metrics: { views, likes, comments }
}
```

Display embedded player, fade-in thumbnail, click-to-play, metric bar animation.

#### 2. `TweetEmbedCard`:

```ts
props: {
  tweetId: string,
  authorHandle: string,
  content: string,
  sentiment: string
}
```

Styled like Twitter embed, with animated frame, sentiment badge, and “View Thread” link.

### 🧾 **Descriptive Brand Profile Form (Onboarding)**

Make it feel like the user is designing their own magazine. Ask:

* Brand Name
* Logo Upload
* Website / Social Handles
* Pick Your Niche (dropdown w/ icons)
* Describe Your Audience
* Select Your Brand Personality:

  * Calm, Bold, Quirky, Professional
* Choose Your Digest Style:

  * Minimalist / Colorful / Compact / Visual
* Pick a Font & Primary Color

This config feeds into both:

* Thematic styling
* Prompt generation for the LLM

---

### 📦 **How the Digest Data Is Used:**

LLM generates a JSON object in this structure:

```json
{
  "brand": "GlowCare",
  "niche": "skincare",
  "theme": "pastel",
  "palette": {
    "primary": "#FDE6E6",
    "accent": "#FFB6B6"
  },
  "generated_at": "2025-07-21",
  "sections": {
    "top_content": [...],
    "audience_sentiment": {...},
    "creators": [...],
    "takeaways": [...]
  }
}
```

Frontend uses this JSON to render each block dynamically, styled per brand.

---

### 💡 Bonus: Micro-Interaction Ideas

* Scroll animations (parallax layers or kinetic text)
* Toggle to show/hide metrics
* Hover-reveal “why this post matters”
* Loading shimmer for incoming embeds
* Digest page entry animation (like flipping a page)

---

### 🔐 Auth & Data Flow

* Supabase for login + brand profile storage
* Store digest JSONs in a `digests` table
* Option to “Re-generate Digest” from frontend → triggers LLM via backend
* History view of past digests (card view or timeline)

---

### 🔚 Final Summary:

Build a **visually engaging, branded, animated digest website** that feels like a digital magazine. Each page is:

* Themed by niche and brand identity
* Embeds live content from social platforms
* Contains actionable, LLM-generated insights
* Feels fun, fluid, and modern — no sterile SaaS vibes here
